# Bee Honey Game

It is a cute Python game I made in a Udemy course where you can control a bee with your mouse.
You must avoid the spiders to maintain the lives and collect the flowers to increase the score.

To recreate this project you just need to install pygame first:

```python
pip install pygame 
```

To start the game please run 'Main.py' file.

Hope you have fun! :)
