# Bee Honey Game

It is a cute Python game I made in a Udemy course where you can control a bee with your mouse.
You must avoid the spiders to maintain the lives and collect the flowers to increase the score.

To start the game please run 'Main.py' file. 

You must have 'Pygame' installed in your Python environment, please check 'requirements.txt' for more information.

Hope you have fun! :)
